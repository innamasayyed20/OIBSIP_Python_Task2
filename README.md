# OIBSIP_Python_Task2 – BMI Calculator

## 📌 Objective
To develop a simple and user-friendly Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator using Python that allows users to input their height and weight, calculate BMI, and display the corresponding health category.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter (for GUI interface)  
- Math module  

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Input fields for height and weight
- BMI calculation using standard formula
- Classification of BMI into categories:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- Input validation to prevent incorrect values
- Clear and responsive design
- Full-screen interface for better visibility

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Designed the UI layout using Tkinter.
2. Added input fields for height (meters) and weight (kilograms).
3. Implemented BMI calculation logic.
4. Classified BMI results based on standard ranges.
5. Displayed BMI value and health category.
6. Enhanced UI appearance for better user experience.
7. Tested the application with different inputs.

## 📐 BMI Formula Used
BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) × Height (m))

## ✅ Outcome
A fully functional BMI Calculator application that accurately computes BMI and displays the health category through a clean and interactive interface.
